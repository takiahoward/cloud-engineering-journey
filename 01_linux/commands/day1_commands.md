# Day 1 — Essential Linux Commands (Navigation + File Management)

These are the commands I learned and practiced on Day 1 of my Cloud Engineering Linux training.

---

## 📍 Navigation Commands

### `pwd`
Prints the **current working directory**.  

### `ls`
Lists files and folders in the current directory.

### `ls -al`
Lists **all** files including hidden ones, with details.

### `cd ..`
Moves **up one directory level** (to the parent folder).

### `cd /`
Moves to the **root** of the filesystem.

## 📁 File & Folder Commands

### `mkdir <folder>`
Creates a new folder.

### `touch <filename>`
Creates an empty file.

### `mv <source> <destination>`
Moves or renames a file.

### `cp <source> <destination>`
Copies a file.

### `rm <filename>`
Deletes a file.

## 📄 Viewing & Editing

### `nano <filename>`
Opens a file for editing in the nano text editor.

**Saving in nano:**  
- `CTRL + O` → save  
- `ENTER` → confirm filename  
- `CTRL + X` → exit

## 📂 Useful Shortcuts

### `~`
Represents **home directory**.

### `.`

## ✔ Summary
Commands learned today:

- Navigation: `pwd`, `ls`, `ls -al`, `cd`, `cd ..`, `cd ~`, `cd /`
- Folder management: `mkdir`
- File management: `touch`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`
- Editing: `nano`
- Special paths: `.`, `..`, `~`

These form the foundation of almost everything I’ll do later in cloud engineering, including EC2, Docker, Terraform, and troubleshooting.
